Test For Admin
==============

Console Program to test whether User is running program with Elevated permissions.
From StackOverflow, with thanks to all the persons answering various questions with code examples.

For VS2013

Build the program and run with debugging. Since I run VS as elevated, then Visual Studio also runs the program with elevated permissions.

Open a CMD prompt without elevated permissions (ie not Run as Administrator) and run program from the bin\Debug directory, and see that it is not elevated.
