Test For Admin
==============

Console Program to test whether User is running program with Elevated permissions.

Build the program and run with debugging. Since I run VS as elevated, then see that Visual Studio also runs the program with elevated permissions.

Open a CMD prompt without elevated permissions (ie not Run as Administrator) and run program from the bi\Debug dir, and see that it is not elevated.
